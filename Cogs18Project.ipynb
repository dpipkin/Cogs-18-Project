    "For my project I wanted to make a program to help me make decisions regarding food and drink (something I always have a problem with). When I'm on campus it's hard to decide what drink or food to get. Sometimes I want something without caffeiene, sometimes I want something light, and so on. It's also hard to decide where to get food. I'm getting tired of the options from eating here so often, so it's easier if I can narrow down the choices. From there, I got the idea for a program to suggest what I should get based on what I want out of the drink or food. The design is kind of specific to me. The dictionaries are based on what drinks I like to get and where I like to eat/what I get there usually. I used functions that checked the dictionaries for the item that matched what I wanted. For the drink, I chose caffiene content (o is low 1 is high), creamy or light, what price I want (0 is cheaper 1 is expensive), and whether it should be hot or iced depending on the weather. For the restuarant, I based it on whether my usual dish has strong or mild flavors, a big or small portion size, the price (0 is under 8 dollars 1 is over 8 dollars), and whether it is in Price Center (PC) or not (not in PC). \n"
